REST API Server and Web Client


## Description

This is my implementation of a small REST API as described in the exercise, and a web client which consists of a single HTML file with JavaScript in it for the backend.

It is composed of 2 files:
- **server.js**: Implements the REST API.
- **client.html**: Implements the web client. You only need a web browser to open it.

## Environment Details

- Node JS: v16.18.0
- npm: 8.19.2
- Tested with Chrome: 106.0.5249.119
